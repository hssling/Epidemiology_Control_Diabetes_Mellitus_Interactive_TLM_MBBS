## Disease Burden

### Global Burden
- **2019**: Ranked 9th leading cause of death
- **Annual deaths**: 6.7 million
- **Years lost due to disability**: 160 million DALYs
- **Contribution to premature mortality**: 3.6%

### Indian Burden

#### Mortality
- **Annual deaths**: 240,000-300,000
- **Age-standardized death rate**: 60.5 per 100,000
- **Ranking**: 7th leading cause of death in India

#### Disease Burden (DALYs)
- **Total DALYs**: 8.5 million (2.4% of total burden)
- **Years of life lost (YLL)**: 4.8 million
- **Years lived with disability (YLD)**: 3.7 million

#### Economic Burden
- **Annual cost**: $40-50 billion (2.5-3% of GDP)
- **Direct costs**: Hospitalization, medication, monitoring
- **Indirect costs**: Lost productivity, premature mortality
- **Macroeconomic impact**: Reduced workforce, increased dependency ratio

## Trends in India

### Prevalence Trends (2000-2021)
| Year | Prevalence (%) | Total Cases (Millions) |
|------|----------------|------------------------|
| 2000 | 5.5 | 31.7 |
| 2005 | 6.5 | 40.9 |
| 2010 | 8.3 | 61.3 |
| 2015 | 9.8 | 69.2 |
| 2020 | 10.8 | 88.9 |
| 2021 | 11.4 | 101.2 |

### Projected Trends
- **2030**: 140.2 million (14.5%)
- **2045**: 160.0 million (16.0%)
- **Annual growth rate**: 3-5%

### Regional Trends
- **Urban areas**: 15-20% prevalence expected by 2030
- **Southern states**: Continuing high prevalence
- **Northern states**: Faster rise projected
- **Rural areas**: Catch-up phenomenon expected

## Risk Factors Correlation

### Major Contributors to Burden
1. **Demographic transition**: Aging population
2. **Urbanization**: 30% of burden attributed
3. **Lifestyle changes**: Dietary shifts, reduced activity
4. **Obesity epidemic**: BMI >25 associated with 2.8x risk
5. **Genetic factors**: Asian Indian phenotype

### Emerging Trends
- **Youth onset**: More cases in 20-30 age group
- **Double burden**: Urban excess, rural catch-up
- **Gender convergence**: Increasing in females
- **Comorbidity burden**: CVD, obesity, hypertension

## Global Comparisons

### Diabetes vs Other Diseases
| Disease | Global Prevalence | Indian Prevalence |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| Diabetes | 10.5% | 11.4% |
| Hypertension | 31.1% | 29.8% |
| Obesity | 13.8% | 40.3% |
| CVD | 8.9% | 28.1% |

### LMIC vs HIC Burden
- **Developing countries**: Higher relative burden
- **Developed countries**: Better management, higher costs
- **India-specific**: High burden, low awareness, inadequate treatment

## Public Health Implications

### Health System Impact
- **Healthcare expenditure**: 10-15% of total healthcare budget
- **Hospital admissions**: 1 in 4 related to DM
- **Primary care burden**: 40% of consultations
- **Specialist care**: Shortage of endocrinologists

### Socioeconomic Consequences
- **Workforce impact**: 1.5 million productive life years lost annually
- **Family burden**: Multiple hospital visits, medication costs
- **Intergenerational impact**: Heritability increases transmission
- **Health inequality**: Urban-rural and rich-poor divide
