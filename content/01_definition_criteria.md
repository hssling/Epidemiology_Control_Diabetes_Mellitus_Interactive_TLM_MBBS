# Diabetes Mellitus: Definition and Diagnostic Criteria

## Definition

Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by chronic hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both.

## WHO Definition (1999, Updated 2019)
"A metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both."

## American Diabetes Association (ADA) Definition
"Diabetes mellitus is a group of diseases characterized by high blood glucose levels that result from defects in the body's ability to produce and/or use insulin."

## Historical Perspective
- **Ancient Times**: Known as "Honey Urine" due to sweet taste
- **1921**: Discovery of Insulin by Banting and Best
- **1950s-1960s**: Description of different types
- **1970s**: Development of insulin pumps and self-monitoring
- **1980s**: HbA1c as diagnostic tool
- **1990s-2000s**: New oral agents and incretins
- **2010s**: SGLT2 inhibitors and advanced insulins

## Diagnostic Criteria (ADA 2024)

### A. Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG)
- Diabetes: ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L)
- Prediabetes (IFG): 100-125 mg/dL (5.6-6.9 mmol/L)
- Normal: <100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L)

### B. 2-hour Plasma Glucose (2hPG) during OGTT
- Diabetes: ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L)
- Prediabetes (IGT): 140-199 mg/dL (7.8-11.0 mmol/L)
- Normal: <140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L)

### C. Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c)
- Diabetes: ≥6.5% (48 mmol/mol)
- Prediabetes: 5.7-6.4% (39-46 mmol/mol)
- Normal: <5.7% (<39 mmol/mol)

### D. Random Plasma Glucose
- Diabetes: ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) + symptoms

## Key Points:
1. **Symptomatic patients**: Any single abnormal value is diagnostic
2. **Asymptomatic patients**: Require confirmation with repeat testing unless HbA1c ≥6.5%
3. **Whole blood vs Plasma glucose**: Always use plasma glucose values
4. **Point-of-care testing**: May have small differences from lab values
5. **OGTT**: Gold standard for diagnosis in specific situations

## Clinical Presentation Threshold
- Asymptomatic: FPG ≥126 mg/dL or 2hPG ≥200 mg/dL or HbA1c ≥6.5%
- With classic symptoms: Any random glucose ≥200 mg/dL

## Special Considerations
- Pregnancy: Use pregnancy-specific criteria
- Children: Age-specific considerations
- Acute illness/stress: May cause transient hyperglycemia
- Medications: Some drugs can affect glucose metabolism

## Laboratory Testing Considerations
### Specimen Collection
- Fasting: No caloric intake for ≥8 hours
- OGTT: 75g glucose load after overnight fast
- HbA1c: Assay standardization important

### Assay Methods
- Glucose: Hexokinase method preferred
- HbA1c: HPLC or immunoassay (NGSP certified)
- Point-of-care: Require calibration

## Classification System
The ADA classifies diabetes into four main categories:
1. Type 1 DM
2. Type 2 DM
3. Specific types of diabetes due to other causes
4. Gestational DM

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the metabolic basis of DM
- Master diagnostic criteria for DM
- Differentiate between DM types
- Apply appropriate diagnostic testing
- Recognize when to suspect DM diagnosis
